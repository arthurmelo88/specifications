<h2>Overview</h2>



















Release 1.0.2 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR specifications includes 15 executed Change Requests (CRs) from a total of 19 proposed (see <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel">History</a>), and 3 resolved Problem Reports (PRs). The CRs&nbsp;have the following breakdown:<br />






<ul>






  <li>Correct typographical errors: SPEC-249, 255, 257, 258, 274, 284</li>






  <li>Descriptive text improvements: SPEC-253, 275</li>






  <li>Minor errors in formal specifications: SPEC-256,&nbsp;&nbsp;260, 268, 271, 283</li>






  <li>Minor formal enhancements/clarifications: SPEC-251, 261</li>





  <li>Rejected/superseded: SPEC-250, 252,&nbsp;269, 272</li>






</ul>
The CRs causing changes to the formal specifications are summarised as follows:<br />
<br />
<table style="text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-251">SPEC-251</a></td>
      <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allow both pattern and interval constraint on Duration in Archetypes</span><br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Affects</span>: ADL, AOM specifications<br />
ADL now supports a constraint on durations allowing both ranges and unit types (weeks, days etc) to be expressed together, e.g.:
some_duration matches {PWD/|P0W..P50W|}<br />
This is typically used for pregnancy duration constraints.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-256">SPEC-256</a></td>
      <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct extension_validity in UID_BASED_ID class</span><br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Affects</span>: Support IM specification<br />
The text for the has_extension function is changed to indicate that the
Result is True if extension is not empty (rather than not Void).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-260">SPEC-260</a></td>
      <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct the regex published for the ARCHETYPE_ID type</span><br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Affects</span>: Support IM specification<br />
The proposed solution is as below, and has the following features:
      <br />

- the characters #, ( and ) are not allowed
      <br />

- no part (i.e. any section between '-' or '.' delimiters) can be only 1 character long
      <br />

- no name part can start with a digit
      <br />

- allows upper case in the alphabetic parts of the id
      <br />

- limiting the version part of the id to numbers (i.e. no letters)
      <br />

- not allowing a leading '0' in the version identifier</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-261">SPEC-261</a></td>
      <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Indicate how accuracy is treated over add/subtract operations in DV_QUANTIFIED types</span><br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Affects</span>: Data Types IM specification<br />
1. in the class DV_AMOUNT, accuracy_unknown: Boolean is added as a
function, and a constant called Unknown_accuracy_value of type Integer,
with value = -1 is added. The documentation is changed to indicate that
a value of -1, i.e. accuracy = Unknown_accuracy means no accuracy
recorded, and the accuracy_unknown function returns True.
      <br />
2. The class DV_ABSOLUTE_QUANTITY also has accuracy, but defined as
a reference value. The accuracy_unknown function is also implemented in
this class, but returns True if accuracy = Void (i.e. null).

      <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct missing parentheses in dADL type identifiers</span><br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Affects</span>: ADL specification<br />
The dADL grammar is corrected to allow parentheses around type names, as in the following example from the ADL specification:<br />
destinations = &lt;
      <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;["seville"] = (TOURIST_DESTINATION) &lt;
      <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....

      <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct minor inconsistencies in ITEM_TABLE specification and example</span><br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Affects</span>: Data Structures IM<br />
The ITEM_TABLE.ith_row() function is updated to the following:
      <br />
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
ith_row (i:Integer): CLUSTER
      <br />

require
      <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;i &gt;= 1 and i &lt;= row_count
      </div>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td><a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-283">SPEC-283</a></td>
      <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct spelling of ELEMENT.null_flavor attribute to null_flavour</span><br />
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Affects</span>: Data Structures IM<br />
The null_flavor attribute in the reference model class ELEMENT is
renamed to null_flavour to match the published XML-schema.</td>

<h2>Impact Analysis</h2>






<h3>


Software implementations:</h3>






<ul>






  <li>ADL parsers:</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li><a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-251">SPEC-251</a>.
Parsers other than the EIffel reference parser and the java reference
project parser will need to be updated to take account of the added
syntax for pattern/interval duration constraints.</li>






    <li>Due to <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-268">SPEC-268</a>,
parsers need to be upgraded to handle parentheses around type names in
embedded dADL blocks in ADL archetypes, such as the C_DV_QUANTITY
blocks found in many archetypes. It is recommended that tools handle
both forms for the time being, with conversion to the legal form being
made in environments where it is safe to do so.See  <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/dev/TOOLING+COMPATIBILITY+GUIDE">wiki page</a> on tooling issues.</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






  <li>Rerence Model implementations:&nbsp;</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>






    <li>the regular expression pattern for legal ARCHETYPE_IDs has been corrected. See <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-260">SPEC-260</a> and the Support IM specification.</li>






    <li>some implementations may have used the US spelling for the
ELEMENT.null_flavour attribute. This has been corrected to
international English spelling. See <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-283">SPEC-283</a>.</li>






    <li>Implementations of the DV_QUANTIFIED types will need to be augmented to include the improved semantics for accuracy. See <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-261">SPEC-261</a>.</li>






  
  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>






</ul>






<h3>XML-schemas</h3>






<ul>




  <li>BaseTypes.xsd</li>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>technical correction to make UID_BASED_ID an abstract class; this has no effect on any system or data.</li>


    <li>DV_AMOUNT class, a default value is added to accuracy element.
The default value will be used when the accuracy is empty. However,
when accuracy is not provided, then there will no default value for
accuracy.</li>


  
  
  </ul>

  <li>Resource.xsd</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>make AUTHORED_RESOURCE abstract</li>

    <li>make RESOURCE_DESCRIPTION.details element mandatory, i.e. change minOccurs="0" to minOccurs="1"</li>

  
  </ul>




</ul>






<h3>Existing Archetypes and Templates</h3>






<ul>






  <li>The identifiers and filenames of some existing archetypes violate
the rules published in the Support IM specification, due to the use of
the ".v1draft" pattern. For the moment, tools should continue to
support this form, converting to the new form where practical. See
the <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/dev/TOOLING+COMPATIBILITY+GUIDE">wiki page</a> on this issue. A new draft of the rules for archetype and template identification and referencing will soon be published.</li>






  <li>Due to the correction of <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-284">SPEC-284</a>,
a few existing ADL archetypes only have misnamed subsections in the
ontology section: term_binding should be term_bindings;
constraint_binding should be constraint_bindings (i.e. both in the
plural). Tools should accept both&nbsp;spellings for some time and
automatically convert to the new spelling where safe to do so on saving.</li>






  <li>Due to  <a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/browse/SPEC-268">SPEC-268</a>,
many existing archetypes contain an illegal form of dADL block,
introduced by a type name (most often C_DV_QUANTITY) that should be
enclosed in parentheses but is not. Tools should perform conversions in
environments where it is safe to do so. See <a href="http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/dev/TOOLING+COMPATIBILITY+GUIDE">wiki page</a> on tooling issues.</li>
