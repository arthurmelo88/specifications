title:		Locking semantics of EHR check-out check-in not defined

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM.EHR

problem_description: Formal semantics are required for locking of Compositions
		in the EHR due to modification, in the same way such semantics are
		required in software configuration management systems. There are
		various possibilities:
			- check-out causes locking; problem: what if no check-in in
			  reasonabe time?
			- check-out causes time-limited locking - lock disappears
			  after a certain time, or is given away on another request
			  to change. Have to be careful with complexity here.
			- check-out does not create locks, and merging is needed to
			  resolve conflicting changes.
		It would be possible to employ all of these strategies in a
		system, with different ones being applied to specific data, or
		specific Composition groups.
