title:		Need "referring" Compositions in EHR Extracts?

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM.EHR_EXTRACT

problem_description: Is there a need to include Compositions in an Extract
		which contain links pointing inward to any of the Compositions
		requested in the extract; in other words, should Compositions
		which consider the requested Compositions to be targets or logical
		parts also be includable by request in the Extract?

		A credible clinical scenario for this needs to be established.
