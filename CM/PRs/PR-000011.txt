title:		Differentiate between existing and introduced attestations

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM.EHR_EXTRACT

problem_description: [Due to requirements brought up by Torbjorn Nystadnes
		representing Norway at CEN WGM 1-3 Feb 2004 Crete]. The current
		CEN 13606 model allows for one list of attestations per VERSION
		object. The requirement is that for any version, the set of
		attestations should consist of new ones introduced in the new
		version and the existing ones from the previous versions, relating
		to parts of the content which are unchanged (and for which
		therefore the attestation still holds).

		OpenEHR uses the same kind of model in the COMMON package. The
		question is whether this part of the model needs to be changed, or
		whether only the EHR Extract needs to be changed, to show, for a
		given version what attestations still apply.
