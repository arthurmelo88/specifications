title:		Time service id needed for time stamps?

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM.DATA_TYPES.QUANTITY.DATE_TIME

problem_description: There may be a need for reliable timestamping in the EHR,
		where an official timeservice is used. If so, the time stamp id
		would need to be stored somewhere. Currently there is only the
		DV_DATE_TIME type; this would require an extra attribute. Or is an
		official timestamp a new subtype?
