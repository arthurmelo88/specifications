title:		Support needed for EHR "watchlist"

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM.EHR

problem_description: Add list of symbolically identified variables from within
		EHR for easy access by querying and applications. Variables might
		include things like $weight, $age, $sex, $smoking_status,
		$diabetic_status and so on. Different sets of variable for each
		patient are likely, based on their situation. These variables
		would probably be implemented as a list of named paths or queries,
		enabling applications to do the queries without having to build
		the paths themselves. Each path for a potentially queryable item
		would be built during writing, not reading, to improve the
		performance of querying. 
		
		In order to enable interoperability for applications, the
		watchlist should probably be implemented in the EHR API.
