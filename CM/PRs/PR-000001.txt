title:		Vocabulary needed for RELATED_PARTY.relationship

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM all

problem_description: Details of vocabularies are needed for various 
		attributes in the openEHR models. These include-
		vocabulary for RELATED_PARTY.relationship?
		  HL7 only has RoleClass, which includes all kinds of 
		  relationships, some in appropriate for clinical sitations.
		vocabulary for VERSION_AUDIT.change_type. Possible values 
		  include: “corrected to”, “later found to be”, “in retrospect”
		vocabulary for TERMINOLOGY_IDs themselves. Ids should 
		  probably be coded from ISO 11179. For registered coding 
		  schemes; this standard also includes ranges for local code 
		  schemes. Get details for ISO7826 (see 13606); superseded 
		  by ISO 11179? See also HL7 domain CodeSystem. Problem - 
		  how to include local ids, ids not yet put in by HL7 or 
		  ISO? Need an online real-time system...
		vocabulary for DV_QUANTITY.property names. Could one be derived
		  from CEN ENV12435?
