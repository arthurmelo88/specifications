title:		Semantics of informal care teams supported.

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM.EHR

problem_description: A care team for a diabetic patient is not formally
		constituted in the health system or a hospital in the same
		way as e.g. a cardiac unit in a hospital - the members are only
		connected by the patient (at least currently - a shared EHR would
		change that). However, there is a need to be able to a) identify
		the team of people via their patient record, and b) be able to
		find out when was the last time each of them saw the patient (e.g.
		for comparison to a management guideline which indicates certain
		types of check-up every so many months etc).
