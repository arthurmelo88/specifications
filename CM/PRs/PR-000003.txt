title:		QUANTITY_RATIO does not correctly model reality

status:		opened

[problem description]
component:	RM.DATA_TYPES.QUANTITY

problem_description: In many cases, the structure of a QUANTITY_RATIO is 
		{substance, qty}/{substance, qty}. This is true in treatments 
		and other mixtures - e.g. 2% LPC in Aqueous cream - means 2gm 
		of LPC in 100gm of Aqueous cream. We also have multiple additives 
		such as 5% LPC and 2% Salicylic acid in coconut oil. We can mix 
		drugs in a litre of Normal saline and give it as an 
		administration - such as Syntocinon in 4% Dextrose and 1/5 Normal 
		Saline. I think that such complexities have to be dealt with in 
		the Medication order archetype. 
		
		SH: I do not think a single datatype can deal with all of this!
