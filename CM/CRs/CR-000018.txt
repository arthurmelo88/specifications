title:		Create new DIRECTORY class

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	Change
impact_analysis:		minimal impact on documents, implementations.

analyst:	Thomas Beale, Andrew Goodchild

problem_description:	Without a class which models the notion of 'directory'
		itself, we are forced to use VERSION_REPOSITORY<FOLDER>. THis is 
		messy in some languages, and does not provide an easy place to 
		have logic which relates to the concept of a directory as a whole.

change_description:	A new class DIRECTORY should be added, which inherits
		from VERSION_REPOSITORY<FOLDER>. This class is then a
		self-contained 'directory of folders', which makes the EHR model
		more consistent (since there is already VERSIONED_TRANSACTION 
		bound to VERSION_REPOSITORY<TRANSACTION>) and provides a class for
		implementors to add drectory-wide semantics.
