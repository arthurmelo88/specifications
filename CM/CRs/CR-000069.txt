title:		Correct date/time types statistical descriptions

owner:		ARB

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	error

analyst:	Andrew Goodchild, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The probable_date and possible_date features of the
		DV_PARTIAL_XXX classes do not generate statistically neutral ranges 
		or dates, since using a midpoint for e.g birthdates with no month 
		or day would skew the database toward june births. 

change_description:  The probable_date and possible_date features of the
		DV_PARTIAL_XXX classes should either be removed or changed to some
		neutral names, and the text amended.

		DK: Surely statistical functions (even differences) are relatively 
		ambiguous in coarse grained date or time specifications. Whilst 
		humans might do this, I suspect that a computed function provided 
		as part of the EHR server is not safe. E.g. one cannot even calculate 
		someone's age today correctly if only the year of birth is known, 
		but a human would work on an approximation. Shouldn't we therefore 
		remove these functions?
