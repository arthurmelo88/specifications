problem_description: There does not appear to be a clear way to set the 
		displayed attribute of the ITEM class in a reliable or
		interoperable way. The original idea was that it would indicated
		if something had been displayed in a source system, enabling a
		receiver system to display things in the same way. However, there
		is no way the displayed/undisplayed status of data can be written
		into the data itself. Further, the current Entry model includes
		protocol as a distinct attribute, and most of not all information
		which does not by default need to be displayed is found in here.

change_description:  Remove the ITEM.displayed attribute.
