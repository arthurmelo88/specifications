title:		Fix ordering bug when use_node used

[change information]

change_category:	error

analyst:		T Beale

problem_description: If a use_node node is used in an ADL archetype anywhere
		other than as the last in a series of nodes of the various types
		C_COMPLEX_OBJECT, ARCHETYPE_SLOT, and ARCHETYPE_INTERNAL_REF (i.e.
		other use_node nodes), the parser dies.

change_description: The syntax rules of ADL have to be changed slightly to
		allow a correct parser to be built. The changed rules are:
			- any identifier with a leading capital letter is taken to
			  be a type identifier (i.e. a class name);
			- any identifier with a leading lower-case letter is taken
			  to be an attribute name;
			- the only other place where identifiers exist in ADL is as
			  tags in invariants; here the identifier may have either
			  form (initial upper or lower case).

impact_analysis:		Minor - all current archetypes continue to parse with
		this change.
