analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: The partial date/time classes in the data types
		specification contain three errors, previously not found due to not
		being compiled as part of the formal reference model. They are:
		- the type of the function "enclosing_interval" should be
		  DV_INTERVAL<T> not INTERVAL<T>, in order to be compatible with
		  other DV_ date/time types that would likely be part of
		  processing
		- the attribute "magnitude" in DV_TIME has been defined as Integer, 
		  which is incompatible with the inherited magnitude - it should
		  be Double.
		- the post-conditions for DV_PARTIAL_DATE.magnitude and
		  DV_PARTIAL_TIME.magnitude are wrong.
		In addition, the UML diagram contains the wrong type for
		DV_TIME.magnitude, and DV_PARTIAL_TIME.magnitude is missing.

change_description:  The following changes are made:
		- correct type signatures of the "enclosing_interval" functions to
		  DV_INTERVAL<>.
		- change DV_TIME.magnitude to be of type Double, same with
		  DV_PARTIAL_TIME
		- correct the UML diagram to match the class definitions.
		- correct the post-conditions to be:
			ensure
				Result = enclosing_interval.midpoint.magnitude
