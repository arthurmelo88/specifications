title:		Change abstract NUMERIC to double in DV_QUANTITY.value
owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:		T Beale, A Goodchild, H Sue

problem_description:	It would be simpler and clearer to make
				DV_QUANTITY.value a REAL (probably mapped to a DOUBLE)
				rather than its current model of NUMERIC with 4
				subtypes. THis will facilitate mapping in programming
				languages. It will also map better to the HL7 type PQ.
				Note however that floating point rounding errors are
				very problematic when using doubles as the
				representation for real numbers, so this should be
				carefully considered.

change_description:	Change QUANTITY model in the data types.

impact_analysis:		Change to specifications unproblematic. Changes
				required to implementations of DV_QUANTITY.

changed_components:	Data types RM v 1.7.7
