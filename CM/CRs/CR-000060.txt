title:		Improve modelling of QUANTITY_RATIO class

owner:	CC

status:		rejected

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: a) The DV_QUANTITY_RATIO class should probably be generic,
		i.e.  have the specification DV_QUANTITY_RATIO <N->DV_QUANTIFIED,
		M->DV_QUANTIFIED> - this would allow archetypes to state exactly
		what kind of ratio it was (e.g. mass / volume). 
		
		b) Should it also inherit from DV_QUANTIFIED, as is done in HL7? 
		Have to investigate which of the arithmetic operations are 
		meaningful.

		DK: Supportive of generic approach proposed for a). Not sure if 
		I have understood (b) correctly: a ratio to inherit from a 
		quantity? I thought we previously felt this was inappropriate 
		modelling practice. 

		DK/TB: agree that b) would be incorrect - there appears to be no
		argument for QUANTITY_RATIOs to inherit from QUANTITY.

reason_for_rejection: no change is needed to enable archetypes to specify
		types of ratio numerator and denominator. The second proposal is
		also rejected for the reasons above.
