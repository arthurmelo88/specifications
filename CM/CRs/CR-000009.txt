problem_description:	It appears that 'reasoning' in EVALUATIONs and
		INSTRUCTIONS and 'protocol' in OBSERVATIONs are the same thing -
		they are the 'how' of the ENTRY (maybe the Aristotelian 'formal
		cause'?). There appears to be no instance where they would both be
		needed. SH analysis is that there is just 'data' and 'other stuff'
		in an ENTRY (outside of the 'small' attributes) - the data always
		needed on the screen, the 'other stuff' only optionally; TB agreement.

change_description
		Therefore we should merge protocol and reasoning into one
		STRUCTURE.
		 
		DL has argued for calling the attribute circumstances, but the
		more one thinks about it, 'circumstances' seems more about
		'context' i.e. who, when attributes, aka subject, provider and
		time information. Whereas protocol/reasoning is not about context 
		but about method.
