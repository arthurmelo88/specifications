title:		Add cADL date/time pattern constraints

owner:		PG

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	design

analyst:	Thomas Beale, Sam Heard

problem_description: Currently cADL date/time constraints are in the form
		of ranges of absolute dates and times, which is not useful for
		archetypes which are intended to be time-independent.

change_description:  The kinds of cosntraints needed are as follows:
		date: yyyy-mm-dd	-- full date must be supplied
			yyyy-mm-??	-- partial date - day may be missing
			yyyy-??-??	-- partial date - month and day may be missing

		time: hh:mm:ss	-- full time must be supplied
			hh:mm:??	-- partial time with missing seconds ok
			hh:??:??	-- partial time with missing minutes, seconds ok

		date_time:
			the above can be combined as follows:
			yyyy-mm-dd <any time constraint>
			yyyy-mm-?? ??:??:??
			yyyy-??-?? ??:??:??

		duration:
			any absolute duration, in ISO8601 form, e.g.:
			P0d0h1m0s	-- 1 minute
			P1d8h0m0s	-- 1 day 8 hrs

impact_analysis:	   minimal - makes no difference to current implementations.
