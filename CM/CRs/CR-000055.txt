status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The function "less_than" of the class DV_ORDERED should
		be defined as an inbfix function '<' since infix and prefix
		functions are already used elsewhere. If there are concrete formalisms
		which do not support infix operators, this function can be renamed
		to "less_than" in the relevant ITS.

change_description: Redefine DV_ORDERED.less_than as:
			infix '<' (other: like Current): Boolean
