problem_description: Remove representation link to ITEM; define interfaces only. 
		Move Hierarchical representation package to EHR_Extract Package. Use 
		classes such as X_LIST_S which inherit from LIST_S and add a 
		representation of type ITEM.
		
		Rationale: removes need for EHR apps to use a particular 
		implementation - they just need to obey interfaces of data structures. 
		Hierarchical representation reserved for EHR extracts.

		Note that hierarchical form is actually good for XML, but not for
		relational databases.

analysis: DK: This sounds quite radical! Unless I've misunderstood this is 
		likely to have quite an impact on how the openEHR model is understood 
		and cross-mapped to standards such as CEN and HL7. Suggest this should 
		not be rushed through now for version 0.9.
