impact_analysis:		Documents and implementations of LOCATABLE.
		
analyst:	Dipak Kalra, Tony Austin

problem_description: An attribute is needed on every node to allow for the
		persisting and communication of presentation information relevant
		to each node. In this way, another viewer, or legal person,
		could determine how the information looked on a screen to the
		original person.

		Q: how will this be meaningful when transported?

change_description: Tony Austin suggestion: use references to style sheets.
		Dipak - ehrcom has proposed this is archetyped, and that 
		presentation is not formalised in the model other than the 
		emphasis attribute on item. We could add a string attribute to 
		locatable to test its usefulness, in the spirit of R&D.
