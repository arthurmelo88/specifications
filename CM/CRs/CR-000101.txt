title:		Improve modelling of Structure classes

owner:		ARB

status:		initial


[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:		Thomas Beale, Andrew Goodchild

problem_description: The current model for the STRUCTURE classes means that
		there is an unnecessary intervening CLUSTER in instance structures
		for the ITEM_LIST type, due to the representation attribute being
		only 1:1.

change_description: Change the model to have efficient representations for all
		the data structure types (but still based on CLUSTER and ELEMENT), 
		including ITEM_LIST. Show in the text how these structures would
		be coded in CEN ENV 13606 structures.

impact_analysis:		Medium.
