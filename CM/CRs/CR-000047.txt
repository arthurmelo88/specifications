analyst:	David Lloyd, Thomas Beale, Sam Heard

problem_description: The definitions of the constants representing terminology
		id lists in the RM.SUPPORT.DEFINITIONS package and the
		RM.DATA_TYPES.TEXT package need to be cleaned up. IN particular,
		the specification of which character sets, etc should not be in
		the mainline documentation, but in the support documentation.

change_description: An initial idea was to use the same system of CS subtypes 
		as proposed in the CEN data types CEN TS 14796 (jan 2004).

		A better solution has been proposed in which all codes and terms 
		required in the reference model are defined in the support model 
		and invariants are used in the rest of the RM, of the form:

		From the PARTICIPATION class:
			Mode_valid: terminology(“openehr”).codes_for_group_name(
				“participation modes”, “en”).has(mode)

impact_analysis:		low
