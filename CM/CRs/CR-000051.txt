problem_description: A more complete analysis of the Observation concept has
		shown that subject state should be included. State is usually 
		used to record patient state over the time during which the
		observation takes place. Typical examples of changing patient
		state during which measurements are taken are:
			- changing physical position or exercise status during BP or
			  pulse measurements
			- fasting and then administration of glucose during a blood
			  glucose test

change_description:	Add the attribute state: HISTORY<T> to OBSERVATION.
