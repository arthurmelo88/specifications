title:		INTERVAL.make_unbounded should be removed

owner:		ARB

status:		implementation


[change information]

change_category:	error

analyst:		Sam Heard

problem_description: Interval has a make_unbounded call. If this make routine is called
		then there is no test to check if the interval remains in this state.
		If it does, then the as_string routine provides a single bound as does
		the out routine. This is compounded in C_REAL and may be in other classes
		that use the interval class.

		It may be best to leave it like this if there is no suitable syntax for an
		unbounded interval - but the make_unbounded should probably not be present.

change_description: Remove make_unbounded or ensure the as_string and other features have
		a syntax for unbounded and there is a status call for unbounded.

impact_analysis: Minor - have changed archetype editor to not set magnitude if no bounds on
		quantity.
