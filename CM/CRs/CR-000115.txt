title:		Correct "/[xxx]" path grammar error in ADL

owner:		ARB

status:		implementation


[change information]

change_category:	error

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: Legal paths in ADL can currently start with an object id,
		e.g. [at0005]/.... However, in these situations, the path is
		always absolute, and should start with a '/', to be compatible
		with Xpath, and with most peoples' idea of an absolute path.

change_description:  Change ADL documentation and syntax to make paths
		starting with [xxx] illegal, and paths starting with /[xxx] legal
		for ab absolute path.
