title:		Correct errors in INTERVAL class

owner:		PG

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	error

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The class INTERVAL in the SUPPORT package incorrectly
		specifies the properties lower_unbounded and upper_unbounded as
		functions; this would work except that for value types such as
		INTEGER, REAL etc, there is no functional way to tell if the lower
		or upper value means  'unbounded', whereas it is possible with
		reference types - the value Void can be interpreted as meaning
		unbounded.

change_description:  Change the properties lower_unbounded and upper_unbounded
		in the class INTERVAL to be attributes.
