[change information]

change_category:	documentation

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: With the advent of the generic Archetype Object Model,
		the "old" AM models are generally not required. On the other hand, 
		custom classes (e.g. C_DV_QUANTITY) have to be specified
		somewhere.

change_description:  The documents are restructured in the following way:
		- Custom constraint type information is removed from the ADL
		  document to a new document, the openEHR Archetype Profile.
		- the existing AM documents are removed.
