problem_description: [Due to discussions at the Jan 2003 CEN meeting in Rome]
		There may be a need to have a status attribute on ATTESTATION
		indicating whether the attestation has been done, or if the item
		is awaiting_attesting, or even  "awaiting_further_attestation" or
		somesuch thing. Currently there is no status, and the ATTESTATION
		class can only be used to represent attestations that have
		actually occurred.

		DK: I note that CDA also has an ability to declare a document as 
		pending attestation. Can I suggest that we review that code-set 
		and agree on revised model for ATTESTATION?

change_description: add an attribute status: COORDIINATED_TERM to ATTESTATION. 
		The possible values from CDA are: signed | intended | required 
		(I|S|X).  This is the HL7 ParticipationSignature domain (value 
		set). See Participation.signature in the HL7 RIM.
