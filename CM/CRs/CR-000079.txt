title:		Change interval value syntax in ADL

owner:		PG

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	design

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: Intervals of integers, dates etc, use the symbols 
		'>', '<' for expressing ones-sided intervals. However, if interval
		values are to be used in dADL, which appears perfectly reasonable,
		these symbols clash with the dADL block delimiters.

change_description:  Intervals should be delimited with  the '|' symbol,
		making for a visually intuitive representation of an interval,
		e.g. |100..200|, |>=60|, |<.005| and so on.

impact_analysis:	   lexical and parser changes required.
