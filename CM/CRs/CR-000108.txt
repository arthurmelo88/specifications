[change information]

change_category:	enhancement

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: The Common.Change_control package contains a number of
		minor problems or inconsistencies, as follows:
		- the attribute 'node' in the class AUDIT_DETAILS is poorly named
		- the 'description' attribute the CONTRIBUTION class should be in
		  the AUDIT_DETAILS class, since any kind of audit record might
		  include a description. For example, BitKeeper has description
		  for both change-set and for every file changed in a change set.
		- rather than inheriting from AUDIT_DETAILS, the CONTRIBUTION
		  class should have an association relation with it, because
		  CONTRIBUTIONS are not as such, audit objects.
		- it would be simpler if the 'change_type' attribute of the class
		  VERSION_AUDIT were moved to AUDIT_DETAILS, since this attribute
		  could be used for audits pertaining to CONTRIBUTIONs as well.
		- following the above changes, the class VERSION_AUDIT can be
		  removed, and the class AUDIT_DETAILS made concrete.

change_description:  The proposed changes are shown in the attached PDF file
		CR-000108.pdf.

impact_analysis:	The Change_control package appears to have been implemented
		by few developers so far. This proposal will cause some changes to
		software, but will simplify the it in the long run.
