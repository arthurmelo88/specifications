analyst:

problem_description:	The standardised representation of dates and times 
		in data transfer will conform to ISO8601 string format in openEHR.
		However, this is not stated. It should be stated in the XML ITS
		and other ITSs describing interoperability formalisms.

change_description:	ISO8601 should be stated as the representation of all
		date/time types in all interoperability ITSs. Note however that
		this does not mean that ISO8601 should be used as the internal
		representation in programming languages or databases.

impact_analysis:		minor changes to data types RM document

changed_components:	Data_types RM 1.7.7
