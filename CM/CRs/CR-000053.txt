title:		Make DV_ORDINAL.limits a function

owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The limits property of DV_ORDINAL  does not need to be 
		an attribute, since there is already an inherited attribute
		reference_ranges which should contain the limits reference range.

change_description: Change DV_ORDINAL.limits from being an attribute to being
		a function which extracts a reference range with meaning "limits"
		from the reference_ranges attribute.
