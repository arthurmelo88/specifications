[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:	Dipak Kalra, Sam Heard, Thomas Beale, Andrew Goodchild

problem_description: Since it is not always possible to determine the purpose
		of a term mapping, the TERM_MAPPING.purpose attribute should be
		made optional. An alternative would be to retain it as mandatory,
		and include an "unknown" value in its vocabulary.
