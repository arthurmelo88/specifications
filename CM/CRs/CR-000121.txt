title:		Improve DV_EHR_URI model to support archetying of LINKs

owner:		PG

status:		initial


[change information]

change_category:	enhancement

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: The current model of DV_EHR_URI contains hard-wired
		Boolean attributes called target_is_ehr, target_is_section etc.
		These were intended to support the constraining of DV_EHR_URIs in
		particular archetypes, by allowing the archetype definer to 
		specify a URI which pointed somewhere in the EHR, to a Compostion,
		Section, Entry, or other specific type of node in the data.
		However, more flexibility is needed. For one thing, there may be a
		need to specify that the link points to something finer-grained
		such as an ITEM_LIST. 
		
		Also the attributes composition_id, section_id and entry_id are
		mutually redundant.
		

change_description:  The boolean target_id_XXX attributes should be replaced
		by a single attribute target_type: String, where the set of
		allowed values is the names of EHR RM concrete subtypes of
		the type LOCATABLE i.e.  "COMPOSITION", "SECTION", "ENTRY", 
		"ITEM_LIST", "ITEM_TABLE", "ITEM_SINGLE", "ITEM_TREE", "HISTORY", 
		"CLUSTER", "ELEMENT".  The attributes composition_id, section_id 
		and entry_id should be replaced by a single attribute called 
		"component_id" or "target_item_id" or "target_id".
