problem_description: The is_normal property of DV_QUANTIFIED is incorrectly
		specified; it should have been a property of DV_ORDERED, since
		this is the class containing attributes for reference_ranges and 
		a normal range.

change_description: Move DV_QUANTIFIED.is_normal to DV_ORDERED.is_normal.
