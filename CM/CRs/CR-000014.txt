problem_description: 

change_description:	There are various proposals to change HISTORY<T>, as
		follows:
		- instead of using orgin & offsets, use intervals in each EVENT
		- make it optional (AG) because many instances of OBSERVATION will
		  not specifically record their own observation time - they
		  'inherit' the time of the clinical session. (TB: I agree with 
		  the point - in today's GP consults - since there is almost no
		  automated recording of anything, but disagree with the solution.
		  Recording of observation time is essential, and even if the
		  absolute times of multiple observations in a GP consult are
		  uninteresting, the order may be significant.

		Dipak - agree with latter, agnostic on former but everyone else 
		appears to be going down the interval pathway. Might make life 
		easier if we follow, since both representations are mappable.
