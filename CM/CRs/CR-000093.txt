title:		Correct anomalies in use of ISO Oids

owner:		PG

status:		completed

[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:	Andrew Goodchild, Sam Heard, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The Class ARCHETYPED currently requires a Uid from its
		archetype, in addition to the archetype_id. This Uid is not
		necessary; if it is required, it can be obtained from the
		archetype.

		The second problem is that a Uid (i.e. an ISO Oid) may be required
		for root nodes in the data. A new Oid would be generated for every
		new root node in all data, regardless of what archetype it came
		from. This would allow the CEN ENV 13606 reference semantics to be
		implemented properly.

change_description:  remove ARCHETYPED.uid; add a new attribute LOCATABLE.uid,
		which is optional.
