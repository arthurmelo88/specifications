problem_description:	Currently there is no statement in openEHR about the
				assumed mappings of the logical types INTEGER, REAL,
				BOOLEAN, INTEGER64 and DOUBLE to the types used by 
				various concrete formalisms. Without stated
				assumptions, there is no guarantee of interoperability
				of these types between any two openEHR systems, even
				if they are using the same data representation on the
				line, e.g. XML.

change_description:	These assumptions should be stated in the ITS for each
				implementation technology. Suggest assumptions are:
				* all INTEGERs in the models are mapped to 32-bit signed integers
				* all REALs in the models are mapped to 32-bit IEEE
				  floating point numbers
				* Except: DV_QUANTITY.value, where the type DOUBLE
				  should always be assumed.
