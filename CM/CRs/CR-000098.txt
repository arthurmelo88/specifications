[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:	Sam Heard, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The time of the clinical session, which is recorded in
		the EVENT_CONTEXT.time attribute is mandatory. However, it is
		often the case that data from outside systems does not include
		the end time.

change_description: Replace the time attribute with two separate attributes,
		start_time and end_time, each of type DATE_TIME, with end_time
		being an optional attribute.
