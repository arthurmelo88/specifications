title:		Add Revision History to change control package

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale, Dipak Kalra, David Lloyd

problem_description: There needs to be a "revision_history" function on the
		VERSION_REPOSITORY<T> type to support EHR_Extract requests for
		revision histories rather than (or with) actual data. There should
		probably be a new REVISION_HISTORY class added. This needs to have
		the information of VERSIONs and VERSION_AUDITs without the actual
		data; probably the attestations should be included.

		The EHR_EXTRACT specification would also need to be changed to
		support revision history requests, probably by adding the ability
		to have a revision history in an X_COMPOSITION.

		DK: I am not sure what use case this serves: I am trying to think 
		of a scenario when version information would be requested without 
		the data to which this pertains.
