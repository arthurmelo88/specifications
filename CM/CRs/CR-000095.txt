title:		Remove property attribute from Quantity package

owner:		PG

status:		completed

[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:	Andrew Goodchild, Zar Zar Tun, Sam Heard, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The property attribute of MEASURED is included to enable
		the function is_strictly_comparable to be evaluated - it provides
		a way of comparing any two Quantities which measure the same
		property, such as 'acceleration'', or even a basic property like
		'mass', where the literal units are different. However, this means
		that property must be provided for each instance of QUANTITY, and
		it is rarely known in legacy or feeder system data. It can be
		inferred if the units string is passed to a quantitative knowledge
		module, however, if we accept that this is required, then property
		is not needed anyway - it can be replaced by a function that
		determines if two unit strings measure the same property.

change_description:  Remove DV_QUANTIFIED.property, and redefine the function
		is_strictly_comparable to compare unit strings for congruence.
