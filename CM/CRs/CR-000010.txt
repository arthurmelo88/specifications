		CONTRIBUTION classes
		
analyst:

change_description:	DK argues that CONTRIBUTION.description should be
		copied to VERSION_AUDIT if the other CONTRIBUTION attributes are.
		This would have the effect that every COMPOSITION would contain
		its reason for addition.

changed_components:	Common RM 1.4.3 VERSION_AUDIT, CONTRIBUTION.
				Common AM 0.5

reason_for_rejection: 	Dipak: well, now we have done this as current openEHR in 
		EHRcom, it may not make so much sense to change it.  My goal was 
		to differentiate clinical data from system data.  However, we 
		have instead managed at this stage to separate the original/changed 
		clinical data from the meta-data about the revision process - 
		suggest that I withdraw this request for the moment.
