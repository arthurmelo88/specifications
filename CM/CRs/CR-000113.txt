title:		Add DATA_VALUE subtype for identifying real-world entities

owner:		ARB

status:		completed


[change information]

change_category:	enhancement

analyst:		Andrew Goodchild, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The openEHR reference model currently does not have a
		type which can be used for identifying real-world entities (RWEs)
		such as prescriptions, lab orders, specimens, people (e.g. by
		social security number or medicare card number) etc. In addition,
		such identifiers should be a subtype of DATA_VALUE, enabling their
		use in archetyped structures based on ITEM_STRUCTURE / CLUSTER /
		ELEMENT.

change_description:  A new type should be added to openEHR data types
		information model as follows:
			class DV_IDENTIFIER inherit DATA_VALUE
				issuer: String -- issuer of id
				id: String -- the id of the entity being identified
				type: String -- the type of entity, e.g. "lab result"
			end
