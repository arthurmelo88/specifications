title:		Make DV_ORDINAL.rubric a DV_CODED_TEXT; type attribute not needed

owner:		CM
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	model change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: If DV_ORDINAL rubric (values like "low", "medium", "high"
		etc) and type (values like "pain", "reflex reaction" etc) are to
		be interoperable, they need to incorporate language, and to be
		coded. 

		The type attribute, in which it was thought that the category of
		values would go (e.g. "pain", "protein concentration" etc) to
		ensure that even if the same symbols were used (e.g. "++"), they
		could not be mixed up.

		A better name for the rubric attribute would be "symbol".

change_description:	Remove the type attribute; change definition of rubric
		attribute to symbol: DV_CODED_TEXT.
