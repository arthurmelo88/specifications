title:		Rename DV_QUANTITY.value to magnitude
owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	Change

analyst:

problem_description:	The attribute name magnitude would be more technically
			correct than 'value', and the latter is confusing because 
			it leads to references to the magnitude of a QUANTITY ELEMENT 
			as 'value.value'. Correspondingly, the derived property
			canonical_value should be renamed to canonical_magnitude.

change_description:	Change DV_QUANTITY.value to magnitude; canonical_value
			to canonical_magnitude.

changed_components:	Data Types RM 1.7.3
				Data Types AM 0.6

impact_analysis:		Change to DV_QUANTITY class, any class containing an
			invariant referring to DV_QUANTITY.value. Also Data types 
			archetype model.
