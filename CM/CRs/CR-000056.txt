title:		References in COMMON.Version classes should be OBJECT_REFs

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The attributes CONTRIBUTION.versions,
		VERSION.contribution, VERSION.version_repository_id should be
		defined to be of type OBJECT_REF rather than OBJECT_ID, since this
		makes the direction of referencing clearer, and OBJECT_REFs
		include the type name of the referenced object.

change_description: Change the three attributes to have the following
		signatures:
			CONTRIBUTION.versions: Set<OBJECT_REF>
			VERSION.contribution: OBJECT_REF
			VERSION.version_repository_id: OBJECT_REF
