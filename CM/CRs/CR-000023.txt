[change information]
change_category:	Change

analyst:	Dipak Kalra, Matthew Darlison

problem_description:	TERM_MAPPING.match should be a coded or enumerated
		type since unbounded integers could be misused. 
		
change_description: TB: should we go back to the original scheme of 
		‘<‘, ‘=’, ‘>’, based on ISO 2788 and ISO 5964? (ISO 
		2788 = ”Guide to Establishment and development of monolingual 
		thesauri” and ISO 5964 = ”Guide to Establishment and 
		development of multilingual thesauri”).

		Dipak - this will have to be a very simple approach if it is to be 
		used consistently. Stan shepherd and henk lamberts originally 
		proposed <, =, > as the set.
