title:		LOCATABLE.synthesised not needed.

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	design

analyst:	Andrew Goodchild, Sam Heard, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The synthesised attribute of LOCATABLE does not solve the
		problem for which it was intended, namely to mark data items which
		were created by a legacy data converter, where such items were not
		available in the source. One problem is that much finer level
		items can be synthesised, such as DATE/TIME time-zone and so on,
		which the synthesised attribute would not cater for.

change_description:  Remove the synthesised attribute. Document that for where
		values or nodes are synthesised in legacy data conversion, a
		FEEDER_AUDIT object should be used.
