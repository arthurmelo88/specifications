problem_description:	It is not yet known where translated EHR content  will
		go in general, since translations may be partial, complete, low or
		high quality etc.

		DK: we should distinguish two cases:
		a) translations specifically verified by the composer/committer and 
		   which might need to be persisted within the EHR along with the 
		   original terms chosen for an Element;
		b) translations automatically generated by a clinical application or 
		   EHR system, which are not legally attributed; they are helpful 
		   but do not necessarily need to be represented or communicated 
		   interoperably.
		How does the new proposed CEN CD data type with its translation 
		association meet these requirements?
