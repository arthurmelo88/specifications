title:		Add remaining HL7 data types

owner:	PG

status:		analysis

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale, David Lloyd

problem_description: The generic probabilistic types defined in HL7 will
		probably have to be mirrored in openEHR, i.e. UVP<T> etc.

analysis: DK: Given active evolution within HL7, CEN and now ISO on data 
		types, suggest deferring this until the standards are more 
		stable, unless we are obviously missing a vital data type 
		ourselves.
