title:		Add HISTORY & STRUCTURE supertype

owner:	PG

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	Change

analyst:	Thomas Beale, David Lloyd, Dipak Kalra

problem_description:	there is no common parent class of HISTORY and
		STRUCTURE apart from LOCATABLE. A common parent could be mentioned
		in archetypes.

change_description: Add a new abstract parent class of HISTORY and STRUCTURE,
		called DATA_STRUCTURE, and rename STRUCTURE to ITEM_STRUCTURE. 
		Then HISTORY and all the other types of structure will be 
		DATA_STRUCTUREs, enabling us to use the one type for ENTRY.data. 
		It will also help align with CDA and CEN which have no HISTORY 
		recording type.	 

		Dipak - yes, this will simplify things and permit easier 
		archetyping of entry sub-types without requiring these sub-types 
		to be in the RM.

impact_analysis:		minimal impact on documents, localised changes to
		implementations.
