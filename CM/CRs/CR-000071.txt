title:		Allow version ids to be optional in TERMINOLOGY_ID

problem_description: Currently openEHR refers to terminologies using a human
		readable identifier, e.g. "snomed_ct", which has a version
		included, e.g. "snomed_ct(2002)". The first problem is that there 
		is no standard for these names. There are Oids defined, but using
		these in archetypes and real data makes them unreadable without an
		Oid-dereferencing service. The second problem is that versions
		seem to be needed because we cannot trust terminologies to stick
		by the rules of never re-using a term code; ICD-9-CM is known to
		be a problem in this regard, although it is being fixed.

		Harold Solbrig suggests to keep human readable names inside a
		known scope (e.g. openEHR) and define a mapping table from them to
		the relevant Oids.  He also supports the use of URI style ids for
		terminologies
		
		Stan Huff thinks that the versions could also be dropped from ids, 
		since we can trust 'most' terminologies, and we can define
		distinct oids for distinct versions of ill-behaved terminologies 
		as if they were separate terminologies (but then there is no easy
		way to tell that such terminologies are closely related).

		DK: I think I'm with Harold, but not with Stan on this! Too much 
		experience of version release errors with Read Codes.

change_description:  Currently we should make the version indicator optional
		in the class TERMINOLOGY_ID.
