title:		Correct reference types in EHR, DIRECTORY classes

owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The type of references used from EHR to CONTRIBUTION
		should not be a value reference, since most of the time, previous
		CONTRIBUTIONs are not of interest. When an EHR object is retrieved
		from a system, usually only the current DIRECTORY/FOLDER structure
		should be retrieved with it. Otherwise, all CONTRIBUTIONs and
		COMPOSITIONs should be left until explicitly retrieved according
		to particular query scenarios.

change_description:	Change EHR.contributions to List<OBJECT_REF>. Correct
		FOLDER.compositions to be List<OBJECT_REF>.
