title:		Rename CLINICAL_CONTEXT.practice_setting to setting
owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	Change

impact_analysis:		Change to CLINICAL_CONTEXT class only.

analyst:

problem_description: The practice setting attribute (taken from CDA) is
		probably not appropriate for self-entered data. However, the
		status of such data still has not been worked out. SH contends
		that it users do not enter EHR data directly - it stays in a
		'holding bay' and is only promoted into the EHR proper by a
		clinician. The same argument may also apply to
		CLINICAL_CONTEXT.location.

		Dipak disagrees - we really are now looking at a culture in which 
		patients do have autonomy over the EHR data - look for instance at 
		the 7 functional roles (or sensitivity levels) proposed by sam - 
		these include a patient-ony option, which must imply there might 
		be no clinician sanction.

change_description:	The attribute should be renamed to 'setting' and used
		for values like 'home', as well as more clinical settings.
