analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: There is currently no vocabulary specified for
		PARTICIPATION.function. In addition, the ENTRY class in the EHR RM
		wrongly states an invariant for provider.function, when the
		invariant should be stated in the common RM PARTICIPAION class.

change_description:  Add "participation function" vocabulary to support RM;
		add invariant to PARTICIPATION class; remove provider.function 
		invariant from ENTRY class.
