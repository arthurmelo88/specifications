problem_description:	The confidence attribute is only meaningful as part of 
		data, e.g. in the case of differential diagnosis, or else it may
		be required on a fine-grained basis for data structures which have
		varying measurement confidences, e.g. the example of a BP where
		the diastolic sound could not be heard well. This latter situation
		seems unlikely, but if true, would suggest that a confidence:REAL
		attribute should be added to ITEM. Else it disappears altogether
		to be taken care of by archetypes.

change_description: remove confidence attribute.
