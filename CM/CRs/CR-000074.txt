title:		Rename COORDINATED_TERM class for standards compatibility

owner:		PG

status:	completed

[change information]
change_category:	design

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The name of the class COORDINATED_TERM is not a generally
		known term among terminology experts. A better name should be
		chosen, one which is also compatible if possible with equivalents 
		concepts in CEN and HL7.

change_description:  The class COORDINATED_TERM should be renamed CODE_PHRASE,
		since this describes exactly what it is, and is a recognised term
		amongst terminologists. It is roughly equivalent to the CV (coded 
		value) class in HL7 and CEN, but not completely, since both of
		these try to model code phrases using qualifiers (CR class in
		HL7), which is probably wrong for a number of reasons:
			* a structural model of linguistic combinations including 
			  plurality, laterality and word order is not in general
			  possible;
			* phrases should only be coordinated inside the knowledge
			  environment, e.g. in a terminology service, not outside.
			  By the time they arrive in the EHR, they should have been
			  coordinated, and the code phrase provided by the
			  terminology service is the key to this coordination.
		For similar reasons, the attribute CODED_TEXT.definition should be
		renamed to "code", which is congruent with HL7 and CEN.

		See CR-000046.

impact_analysis:		Change to documents, change to CODED_TERM and
		COORDINATED_TERM classes.
