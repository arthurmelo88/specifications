[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:	Andrew Goodchild, Sam Heard, Thomas Beale, Dipak Kalra

problem_description: The synthesised attribute of the LOCATABLE class does not
		serve its intended purpose as an attribute on LOCATABLE because it
		does not provide a way for finer grained things to be marked as
		synthesised, e.g. single data items. It also doesn't provide any
		details on the context of synthesis. A better solution would be to
		remove it and use FEEDER_AUDIT objects to document synthesised
		items in more detail.

change_description:  Remove the synthesised attribute and explain the use of
		FEEDER_AUDIT to achieve the same effect. Change
		FEEDER_AUDIT.change_type to DV_CODED_TEXT and supply a proper
		vocabulary for it.
