problem_description: The guideline_id attribute is intended to record the
		identification of a guideline which caused an ENTRY to be created.
		It needs to be available on all ENTRY types.

		A guideline system  might "propose" any kind of ENTRY: the 
		collection of a new observation  , the prescription of a new drug 
		or the ordering of a new test, or as  you suggest propose a new 
		diagnosis. Logically it is part of the why  (reasoning) but ought 
		to be differentiated from the composers reasoning  (which might 
		actually be why they do NOT follow the advice as  referenced by 
		the guideline_id!)
