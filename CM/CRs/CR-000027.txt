[change information]
change_category:	Change

impact_analysis:		

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description:	Since items can be committed in feeder systems
				at any level of detail, feeder audits should be
				placable on fine grained objects, not just
				TRANSACTIONs.
				This will allow e.g. separately committed single 
				values from an ICU feeder system to be turned into
				one ENTRY in the EHR system.

change_description:	Remove feeder_audit attribute from TRANSACTION. Create
				a feeder_audit attribute on LOCATABLE, of type
				FEEDER_AUDIT, which is a class containing mainly 
				optional audit details for feeder systems.

changed_components:	EHR RM 4.3.3
				Common RM 1.4.6
