title:		Add display_as_absolute flag to DV_QUANTITY

problem_description: There are a number of common quantitative types 
		which are commonly displayed and recorded as positive numbers 
		but which are really negative numbers - as far as is known, they
		are all differences over time, such as: weight loss, postural drop
		(since last examination) and so on. A way is needed of marking
		these quantities to be displayed as positive, because they will
		almost always be in reponse to a question which implies the
		negative, e.g. "weight lost since last visit: ". However, it is
		imperative that these quantities are represented and computed 
		normally.

change_description:  A boolean attribute display_as_absolute: BOOLEAN should
		be added to the class DV_QUANTITY. This should be set only for the
		cases mentioned above, and should be ignored by any automatic
		processing. Values stored in instances of DV_QUANTITY where
		this flag is set to True should be stored in the negative if they
		are technically negative quantities (i.e. but not if a positive
		quantity in a series of otherwise negative values).

		DK: I'd like to be clear if this is to ensure unambiguous data 
		interpretation or only to ensure consistent rendering (presentation).
		Is this really to do with medico-legal protection of the
		data-enterer.

		This is really adding an attribute which directs an application to
		display data in a certain way, which does not exist elsewhere in
		the openEHR models; either we do it comprehensively, or not at
		all.

impact_analysis:	   minimal - makes no difference to current implementations.
