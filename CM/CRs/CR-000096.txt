title:		Allow 0..* SECTIONs as COMPOSITION content

owner:		PG

status:		completed

[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:	Andrew Goodchild, Zar Zar Tun, Sam Heard, Thomas Beale

problem_description: There appears to be no reason why COMPOSITION.content is
		limited to being only a single SECTION, since it is easy to find
		examples of COMPOSITIONs that either:
		  a) have multiple archetyped SECTION trees under the COMPOSITION
		     or;
		  b) have multiple SECTIONs which are defined within the
		     COMPOSITION itself.

change_description: Make COMPOSITION.content cardinality 0..*. The case of 0
		would allow COMPOSITIONs with only EVENT_CONTEXT to exist, which
		would be reasonable in an event summary system, where only the
		fact of the event having occurred is recorded.
