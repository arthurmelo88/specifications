title:		Add support for exclusion and inclusion of Interval limits

owner:		ARB

status:		completed


[change information]

change_category:	enhancement

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: Currently, the type DV_INTERVAL<T> and INTERVAL<T> do not
		allow for limit values to be included or excluded from the range -
		they are always assumed to be included. This is theoretically
		alright for Real values, since the next value is infinitisemally
		close, however, it does not work for types with a discrete range,
		such as Integer. It also does not really work well with Reals when
		they are being used to represent a real world value which is in
		practice more or less discrete, due to coarse precision or by-eye
		measuring, e.g. readings from a mercury column.

change_description:  Add attributes lower_included: Boolean, and
		upper_included: Boolean to Interval<T>. Adjust routines
		accordingly in Eiffel reference model.

impact_analysis:		Low impact on models; only changes existing software
		where the new type is needed.
