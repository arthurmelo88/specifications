title:		Replace subject and subject_relationship with RELATED_PARTY
owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:		Change

impact_analysis:		Simplifies and corrects problems in the two ENTRY
		subject attributes. 
		
analyst:

problem_description:	Subject should not be mandatory
		as a PARTY_REF - there are many occasions in which it could be
		inappropriate to include the demographic party ref of the subject
		e.g. foetus, organ donor, anonymous person from whom subject has
		contracted an infection, and even family members. However, the
		relationship is highly important. 
		
change_description:	THe change suggested is to
		replace the subject attributes in ENTRY with just subject:
		RELATED_PARTY, where the latter is defined as follows:

			class RELATED_PARTY
			   party[0..1]: PARTY_REF
			   relationship[1]: DV_TEXT
			end
