title:		Remove to_canonical_string and to_display_string routines

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:

problem_description:	These routines serve no useful purpose in the abstract
	data type specifications, since any standardised serialisation should be
	specified in the ITS for the serialisation formalism, such as XML or
	IDL. Note: there is a dependence on them by invariants in the date/time 
	types, so a routine specific to these types has to be retained for this 
	purpose.

change_description:	Remove all instances of these routines in the abstract
	data types specification.

impact_analysis:		Minimal: change only to documentation. Software is not
	invalidated by this change.

changed_components:	All data types classes.
