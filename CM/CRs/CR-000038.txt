status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Sam Heard, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The organisation or other agent originating or
		maintaining an archetype should not be included as a separate 
		slot in the multi-axial archetype identifier. THe originator 
		is known in the meta-data section of an archetype, and can 
		change, even if the archetype does not change. This would break
		the rule that any change to an archetype which makes is generate
		data incompatible with the archetype on which it is based causes a
		change in id; conversely, there should be no change in id id there
		is no change in content.

change_description:	Remove the first section from the archetype identifier
		class.
