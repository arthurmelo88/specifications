problem_description:	There should be a 'composer' of each TRANSACTION - i.e. 
		primary person who was responsible for it in the clinical sense.
		THis it the id which should appear on the screen. It could be a
		junior doctor who did all the work, even if not legally
		responsible, or it could be a nurse or senior doctor. It may or
		may not be the person who entered the data.

		Dipak - it is not the legally_resp person, who might be in charge 
		but have nothing to do with this composition. Agree it needs to 
		be added.

		TB - recommend calling this attribute 'author' to fit in with CDA
		2.0
