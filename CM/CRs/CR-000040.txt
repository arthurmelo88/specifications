problem_description: When DV_DURATIONs are used in time histories, the
		intended unit of recording, e.g. "mins", "s", "days" etc needs to
		be known. However, this is not the case with DV_TIME, DV_DATE_TIME, 
		DV_DATE, since they are usually understood as points from an epoch
		or origin. Durations used in time based recording commonly differ
		in the primary unit they are recorded in.

analysis: DK: How does this approach fit in with the CEN data types and the 
		likely direction of ISO? It would make sense for us to converge if 
		this is practical and technically rigourous.

		This change is probably not required, since there is aready
		provision for seconds to be the scientific unit for all customary
		time quantities, to enable regular scientific style computation.

change_description:	Add an attribute units: STRING to DV_DURATION, same
		description as DV_QUANTITY.units. Consider moving DV_QUANTITY.
		property to DV_QUANTIFIED, so that the customary time types 
		have the property set to time. In this way, the units for 
		all DV_DURATIONs can be forced to be time units.
