title:		Improve EVENT_CONTEXT modelling

status:		completed

[change information]

change_category:	design

analyst:	Sam Heard, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The EVENT_CONTEXT class needs some adjustments to better
		correspond to the reality it models. Firstly, 'author' should be
		renamed to 'composer', to correspond with the emerging CEN
		ENV13606 standard. 
		
		Secondly, the health_care_facility attribute should be optional, 
		since a care event could occur at the patient's home, with no 
		involvement at all by a care delivery enterprise (e.g. creation 
		of some observations; self-administration of a drug).

change_description:  Rename EVENT_CONTEXT.author to composer. Make
		EVENT_CONTEXT.health_care_facility optional.
