title:		Change DV_DURATION.sign to prefix "-" operation.

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The sign attribute of DV_DURATION is incompatible with
		the normal way of representing negation of a quantity. It is not		
		helpful in computations using durations. A prefix "-" operator
		should be defined to enable normal arithmetic to be used with
		DV_DURATIONs.

change_description: The current sign attribute of DV_DURATION should be
		replaced with a prefix "-" operation. The as_string feature also 
		needs to be modified so that the sign is output at the beginning 
		of the ISO8601 format string.
