title:		Visually differentiate primitive types in openEHR documents

owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	documentation style

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description: The documentation of the openEHR abstract models does not
		visually differentiate between the assumed inbuilt types (Integer, 
		Real, Boolean, Character, String, List<>, Set<>, Array<>) and
		types defined in openEHR (although the Support Reference Model
		does explain the difference). Because of specifications from HL7
		and CEN using a different set of data types in which the
		distinction between e.g. a primitive String and a so-called "ST",
		some readers are not clear on the origin of types in the openEHR
		documentation.

change_description:	It is proposed to change the capitalisation of all
		primitive types to follow the "capitalised" convention, leaving
		the openEHR defined types in upper case. This, the types mentioned
		above will all appear in the documentation as "String", "Integer"
		etc.
