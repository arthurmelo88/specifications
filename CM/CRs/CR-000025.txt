analyst:

problem_description:	In some situations, e.g. ICU, there can be multiple
				simultaneous creators of ENTRYs in a TRANSACTION.
				The ATTESTATION needs to model fine-grained 
				attestations of parts of TRANSACTIONs, so that 
				the attester of of each part of the TRANSACTION is
				known. (Note that the author of each ENTRY is known
				due to ENTRY.information_provider). 

change_description:	The solution is to add an attribute attested_components: 
				Set<EHR_URI> to the class ATTESTATION, allowing it 
				to refer to multiple components of any granularity. 

changed_components:	Common RM 1.4.4
				Common AM 0.6

impact_analysis:		Change to ATTESTATION class
