problem_description:	Recent analysis on an archetype language has shown 
		that all meanings should be archetype-local terms, rather than
		terms coded from external terminologies. This is because a) we
		want archetypes to be valid independent of terminologies, and b)
		there are often archetype node meanings for which no term is
		available, not even in UMLS. 

		SH: only meaning codes are needed on instances, since archetypes
		are always needed to process openEHR data.

		DK: what if there was a translation error in the archetype and the
		e.g. english text of at0017 (meaning= Haemogloblin) should have
		been at0017 (meaning=Haematocrit) instead; the original text
		recorded next to at0017 in the meaning attribute would be the
		wrong value. Problem is that it might be the text that is correct
		from the application's point of view, and the code is wrong. 

		So - the application developer &/or data mapper need the support of
		a normalised name as well as the code, in order to trace what the
		intention of data recording was at any time. In the above example,
		a new version of the archetype would be produced with the
		translation corrected, and all data previously produced with it
		would be corrected by replacing at0017 with at0016 (and presumably
		vice versa). Not recording the text value of the node term in the
		meaning attribute would prevent this from working.
		
change_description: Meanings are thus given codes local to the archetype 
		and these are mapped to one or more terminologies at the bottom 
		of the archetype. The meaning attribute in LOCATABLE and in
		ARCHETYPE_FRAGMENT should be changed to type STRING.

		A further point to consider. Even if the meanings are only 
		archetype local terms, it might be argued that at least the
		term (e.g. 'at0002') and the text (e.g. "systolic blood pressure")
		should be included as the meaning. The problem with this argument
		is that the latter can only be in one language; how should this
		language be chosen from the available languages of the archetype?
		Presumably it would be the language of the locale in which the
		archetype was used, even if this language is not the primary
		language of the archetype.
