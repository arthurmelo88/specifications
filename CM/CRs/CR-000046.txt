title:		Rename COORDINATED_TERM and DV_CODED_TEXT.definition

owner: PG

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	David Lloyd, Thomas Beale

problem_description: It may be useful to rename COORDINATED_TERM to a more
		obvious name, even though the current name is technically correct.
		There may also be a need for it to be a DATA_VALUE inheritor,
		given that the equivalents in CEN TC/251 data types and HL7 data
		types are.

analysis: DK: Suggest that if it is not faithfully like HL7/CEN CD or CV 
		we adopt CODE_PHRASE to assert that it is distinct from and 
		not just our flavour of CD or CV. I seem to recall that our 
		model is somewhere in-between CD and CV in complexity.
		Proposal: adopt change desribed in CR-000074. 

change_description:	Rename COORDINATED_TERM as CODE_PHRASE, and
		DV_CODED_TEXT.definition as code. Also add a function 'rubric' to
		DV_CODED_TEXT which returns the value of the inherited
		'value' attribute to make clear the relationship between the code
		and inherited value as rubric.
