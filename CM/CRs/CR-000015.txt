problem_description:	There needs to be a way of representing empty or
		negative ENTRYs, e.g. for when there is a heading "allergies" and
		the physician wants to put "none". Also the situation when there
		is an OBSERVATION recording "smoking - yes; 1 pack/day" and the
		physican wants to confirm that at a later time (i.e update the
		currency of the fact but the fact itself is no different.)
		
		DK: we could add a third data-quality value, like null flavour,
		whose purpose was to express null/missing/zero, etc.
		We should wait for domain termlist work in CEN to produce
		something as well.

change_description:	Dipak - surely this can be through a) allowing 
		cardinality of zero or more to permit an empty object, and/or 
		b) to use flavour of null to indicate that no value is pertinent here.
		Might need to add an empty composition sometimes, to replace one 
		that was added to the wrong record.  

		DL: the case of empty content Composition, Entry needs to be
		allowed - therefore change should be made to cardinality on
		Composition.content and Entry.data - it should be 0..*.

		DK: Three choices: 
			- specialised attribute none_declared in Entry to indicate 
			  "none"
			- use a standard data element in Entry whose value is e.g. a
			  coded_text "none"
			- name the Entry at runtime to "none" or similar.

		TB: need the effect of an Allergen Entry which evaluates to
		Allergens=none when querying occurs.
