title:		Add HIERARCHICAL_OBJECT_ID to OBJECT_ID model

owner:
status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	change

analyst:	Thomas Beale

problem_description:	The model of the string identifier in OBJECT_ID is
		designed as a hierarchical id, but OBJECT_ID also has the
		ARCHETYPE_ID subtype, which is a multi-axial, not hierarchical id.

change_description:	The correct solution is to create a new class called
		HIER_OBJECT_ID which models these things, as a subtype of
		OBJECT_ID. OBJECT_ID then should not specify any particular
		syntax of the id string. It can be made abstract and its
		attributes local_id and context_id moved to HIER_OBJECT_ID.
