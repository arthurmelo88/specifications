problem_description: [Due to discussions at the Jan 2003 CEN meeting in Rome]
		There may be a need to add a time_validity attribute to LINKs to
		model the fact that some causal links will only be valid for
		certain times. Solid use cases need to be found for this. It
		appears that all the Act.effective_time justifications are already
		taken care of in particular classes in openEHR. It is not clear if
		there are other reasons to recorded intended/expected
		time-validity of a link - one example may be if a provisional test
		result is supplied from a lab - the  "result" link from a causing
		order might have a time-limit set on it.

		TB: A more general approach might be to add other_details:
		STRUCTURE<T> to LINK, enabling it to include any level of details 
		needed in the future. The most likely need is further meta-data
		supporting workflow data representation, going by experience in
		Denmark, for example.

		DK: I think we need to be clearer about use cases for this. I am 
		concerned about putting time validity on links without being clear 
		about the implications for applications retrieving the source and 
		or target components. Suggest defer to v1.0 giving us time to 
		explore further.

reason_for_rejection:
	This CR was created in early 2003 when we thought there should was a need for a
	validity time range on LINKs - this is an HL7 idea which was being recommended 
	at the Rome CEN meeting. Dipak commented later that he did not think it was 
	supported by sufficient evidence. Having since thought about this idea myself, 
	I am also of the opinion that adding a time validity range would be problematic 
	for the following reasons:
	 - in most cases I cannot imagine it being set when it's created - who is 
	going to judge if a link from say test result to a proposed intervention is 
	valid for a week or 20 years?
	 - if the supposed validity time interval becomes known at some later point 
	in time, it seems unlikely that anyone is going to go back and modify such data
	 - I would have thought that the time validity of a LINK in most cases would 
	be defined by how long the link is in use - clearly a vague notion. I.e. is 
	there even a sharp meaning possible for the "time validity of a link" in general?

	Additionally, no implementor has asked for this.
