title:		Add archetypable other_details attribute to FEEDER_AUDIT

owner:		ARB

status:		analysis


[change information]

change_category:	enhancement

analyst:		Andrew Goodchild, Thomas Beale

problem_description: The FEEDER_AUDIT type used in the LOCATBALE class in the
		ARCHETYPED cluster needs an attribute which can be freely
		archetyped, which can contain various data from feeder systems. An
		example from the Brisbane South HealthConnect Trial (BSHCT) in
		Australia is to capture patient ids from HL7v2 messages so that if 
		information from a message is put into the wrong EHR, its source
		system patient id can be used to diagnose and correct the error.

change_description:  Add the attribute other_details: ITEM_STRUCTURE to the 
		class FEEDER_AUDIT.
