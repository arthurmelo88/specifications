title:		Add commentary attribute to DV_ENCAPSULATED

status:		initial


[change information]

change_category:	enhancement

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description: For many instances of DV_ENCAPSULATED, there is a
		corresponding content item in another system, or somewhere on 
		the web for which the instance is a summary, piece of, or bears
		some other relationship. However, the model currently provides no
		attribute for recording what the relationship is. An example is a
		150k JPEG image of an X-ray, where the original data is a series
		of images, each one a 200Mb TIFF image in a Picture archiving 
		system (PACS). There needs to be a way of recording the derivation 
		process or other relationship between the item recorded in the EHR
		and the original item(s). Another example is a small image
		representing the diagnostically significant part of a full
		echo-cardiography study.

change_description:  Add an attribute "comment" to the class DV_MULTIMEDIA.
		Note that in general attributes with such general names should be
		avoided, but it seems difficult to come up with a more specific 
		name here which covers all possibilities.
