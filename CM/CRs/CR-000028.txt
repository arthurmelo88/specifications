title:		Change name of STRUCTURE class to avoid clashes

owner:		PG

status:		completed

[change information]
change_category:	Change

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description:	The class name STRUCTURE clashes with a class of the 
				same name in VB.NET (at least).

change_description:	Rename class in same way as LIST_S, e.g. STRUCTURE_S
		or similar.
		DK: I recognise Heath's concerns. There is no need for us to adopt 
		a name that is unhelpful to implementers. I would suggest a name like 
		ITEM_STRUCTURE. This could be applied to all of the inheritors of
		ITEM_STRUCTURE, i.e. LIST_S -> ITEM_LIST etc.

impact_analysis:		Name change only in specs; unknown impact on
				implementations.
