problem_description: While there is a clear need to be able to differentiate
		between "persistent" (e.g. family history, therapeutic
		precautions) and "event" Compositions (patient contact, test
		result), there may be more types which need to be classified, e.g.
		types such as current medications and problem list whcih are
		currently seen as persistent, perhaps should be a subtype which
		means "persistent, regeneratable", meaning their content may be
		partly derived from querying. Other Compositions to do with e.g.
		pregnancy which are relatively long-lived, but do have finite
		durations and are not of interest for much time past the end,
		should perhaps be marked as "process" or similar.

		One solution would be to change COMPOSITION and
		VERSIONED_COMPOSITION.is_persistent: Boolean to e.g. type:
		DV_TEXT, and make the types a controlled vocabulary.

analysis:	DK: We are about to review the code-set for revision_status in 
		EHRcom to consider these issues. Can I suggest that we adopt a 
		placeholder attribute that is not Boolean, and add a code-set 
		in a couple of months.
		
		The functional behaviour requirements which this attribute
		satisfies should be described in the documentation.

		DL: describe behaviour on record opening, committal, etc.
