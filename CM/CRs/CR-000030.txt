title:		ARCHETYPE.description does not handle foreign languages

owner:	PG

status:		obsolete

[change information]
change_category:	Change

analyst:		Thomas Beale

problem_description:	The purpose, use and misuse fields in the archetype
			meta-data are all free text and may need to be translated 
			if the terminology section of the archetype is translated.

analysis:		Probably change the ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION class so it
			has a 'text' attribute of a new type which contains the 3 
			free text fields, and 0..* more 'text_translation' fields 
			keyed by language, to provide for translations.
			DK: I'd support this.

change_description:	This problem has been resolved by the current
			Archetype Object Model (AOM), which enables all linguistic
			elements of an archetype to be recorded in multiple
			languages.

impact_analysis:		No impact to current specifications
