[change information]
change_category:	Change

analyst:		Tom Beale

problem_description:	The purpose, use and misuse fields in the archetype
			meta-data are all free text and may need to be translated 
			if the terminology section of the archetype is translated.

change_description:	Probably change the ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION class so it
			has a 'text' attribute of a new type which contains the 3 
			free text fields, and 0..* more 'text_translation' fields 
			keyed by language, to provide for translations.
			DK: I'd support this.

impact_analysis:		Minimal change to archetype Common model and
			implementations. Will affect ADL specification slightly, 
			and the ADL parser.

changed_components:	Common AM
				ADL specification
