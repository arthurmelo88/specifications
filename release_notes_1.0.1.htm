<h2>Overview</h2>











Release 1.0.1 is the corrective release to Release 1.0. It fixes
the typographical errors from Release 1.0,&nbsp;includes significant
improvements in the explanatory text of the documents, and includes around 50 CRs (see <a href="history.htm">History</a>). The majority of these have been raised by members of the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR
community either due to detailed review, or due to working with
implementations. The release now appears to be extremely stable. We
believe this release is a true milestone in health computing.<br />

<br />

Functional changes to the models include the following:<br />

<ul>

  <li>original documents can now be linked to or carried inline COMPOSITIONs, in a flexible way;</li>
  <li>improvements in the
rm.common.change_control model of versioning;</li>

  <li>improved modelling in Quantity data types;</li>
  <li>corrections&nbsp;to the date/time data types, which have now been
aligned with the ISO 8601 standard;</li>

  <li>an EHR access control object has
been added, along with an overall description of how security works;</li>

  <li>the definition of
various
identifiers in support.identification was tightened up, and the use of
identifiers made more precise;</li>

  <li>corrected inheritance errors in LOCATABLE;</li>

  
  <li>improvements to resource_description package (rm.common.resource) for use in archetypes;</li>

  <li>numerous improvements to <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR Archetype profile, details of ADL, quoting and unicode.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>


















Many people helped bring this release to fruition, including implementers and reviewers. Thanks to all the people on the <a href="project_team.htm">project team</a>
page. Special thanks to David Lloyd, previously of UCL, now claiming to
be retired (we know otherwise) for his tireless work on the UML models.<br />
