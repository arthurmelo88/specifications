The openEHR Specification project includes all the "spec-*" repositories,
containing the openEHR formal specifications, including for the EHR and 
Demographic reference models, and for ADL (the Archetype Definition Language). 
It also contains 'engineering' expressions of these models, i.e. expressions 
in formalisms designed for direct use in implementation technologies such as 
XML, various programming languages, and database schema languages. These 
engineering expressions are found in the 'engineering' directory.
