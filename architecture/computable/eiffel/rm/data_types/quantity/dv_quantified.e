	description: "[
				 Abstract class defining the concept of true quantified values, i.e. 
				 values which are not only ordered, but whose magnitude is meaningful
				 as well. The defining characteristics of the type is the attribute 
				 magnitude - an accurate notion of quantity of something, and the 
				 difference operation.
				 Units were inspired by the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM), 
				 developed by Gunther Schadow and Clement J. McDonald of The Regenstrief 
				 Institute [4].
