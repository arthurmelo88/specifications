	description: "[
	              General concept of a temporal data structure, i.e. one whose elements are other 
			  spatially complex data structures, each of which appears at a point of time in 
			  a series.  This includes the special (but common) case where there is only one 
			  element, corresponding to a single measurement or observation. In scientific or 
			  clinical medicine, it is logically correct to treat single values and series  
			  the same way, since even single values (however complex structurally) are 
			  situated in time. It is also advantageous since it allows uniformity of processing.
